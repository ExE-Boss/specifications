are a non-standard Gecko specific extension\nto the WebExtensions specification allowing WebExtension authors to do things\nfor which there are no WebExtension APIs.\n\n\nPurpose of Gecko Elevated WebExtensions\n\n\nGecko Elevated WebExtensions are intended to allow Mozilla Firefox to retain\nits status as the browser with the most powerful extension API.\n\n\nDevelopers should use WebExtension APIs wherever possible even when writing\nGecko Elevated WebExtensions to minimize the amount of code that can break\nbetween Firefox releases, because unlike before, Mozilla will no longer\nbe keeping legacy code around, requiring Gecko Elevated WebExtension\ndevelopers to keep pace with Mozilla.\n\n\nmanifest.json\n keys\n\n\nGecko Elevated WebExtensions are denoted by having the\n\napplications.gecko.elevated_background\n key.\n\n\nThe \napplications.gecko.elevated_background\n key\n\n\nThis key is a JSON object containing the following keys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey\n\n\nRequired\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"page\": \"\nPage URL\n\"\n\n\nRequired if \n\"scripts\"\n is not present\n\n\nDefines the elevated background page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"scripts\": [...]\n\n\nRequired if \n\"page\"\n is not present\n\n\nDefines the scripts that are added to the generated elevated background page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"optional\": boolean\n\n\nOptional, defaults to \nfalse\n\n\nSpecifies if this is an optional or required elevated background page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstrict_min_version: \"\nminimum compatible version\n\"\n\n\nOptional, only permitted if this is an optional elevated background page, defaults to the same value as this extension\u2019s \nstrict_min_version\n.\n\n\nSpecifies the minimum

in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe elevated background page\n\n\nThe elevated background page is a special background page in that it has all\nthe supported \nHost\n\nand \nAPI\n\npermissions regardless of what is defined in the \n\"permissions\"\n key.\n\n\nThis is because the elevated background page has unrestricted access to all\nthe browser internals, just like \nLegacy Bootstrapped Extensions\n,\nand as such can just call the underlying implementation of the WebExtension\nAPIs.\n\n\nNote that non-elevated background pages from other extensions can\u2019t message\nelevated background directly, and must instead send the messages using the\nnormal background page as a proxy.\n\n\nElevated background pages from other elevated extensions can message each other\nusing WebExtension APIs for the same reason as to why elevated background pages\nhave access to all WebExtension APIs.\n\n\nOptional elevated background page\n\n\nIf the elevated background page is marked as optional, it is disabled by default\nand the user is given a prompt during installation if this extension\u2019s elevated\nbackground page should be enabled or not.\n\n\nWhether the optional elevated background page should be loaded or not is also\nconfigurable from the extension\u2019s options page in \nabout:addons\n.\n\n\nIt is also possible for the optional elevated background page to have its own\nseparate version compatibility set by Mozilla or the extension author.\n\n\nThe optional elevated background page is always disabled if it is incompatible\nwith this version of Firefox.\n\n\nAPI Changes in elevated background page\n\n\nIn the elevated background page, some APIs have less restrictions than when\ncalled from the normal background page.\n\n\ntabs\n
